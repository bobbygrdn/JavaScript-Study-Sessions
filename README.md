JavaScript Study Sessions
-------------------------

This repo has two different sections, the resources directory and the studyGuides directory. Each one has many documents that you can use to help you learn, grow and become a better developer.

* âš¡  As new study guides or resources get added, we will update this readme to reflect those changes.
